# Aster Code Agent Loop MVP Build Report

Date: 2026-07-05 (stabilized)
Status: SUCCESS — All builds pass cleanly

## Commands Run
1. `npm run typecheck`
   - Outcome: All 3 workspaces typecheck with **0 errors**.
2. `npm run build`
   - Outcome: Built all workspaces. Vite production bundle completed. **0 errors**.
3. `npm run runtime:build`
   - Outcome: Compiled Express backend server agent modules into `dist/`. **0 errors**.

## Stabilization Pass
- Verified post-commit state: typecheck, build, runtime:build all clean
- No TypeScript errors, import issues, or build failures
- Agent module (`apps/runtime/src/agent/`) compiles correctly
- Frontend components (`AgentActivityFeed`, `AgentPlanPanel`) compile correctly
- ChatScreen and SkillsScreen integrate with backend APIs without type errors

## Agent Loop MVP — What Was Built

### Runtime Backend
- **Agent module** (`apps/runtime/src/agent/`):
  - `types.ts` — Re-exports shared types; defines `Session`, `TaskClassification`, `ExecutionContext`
  - `planner.ts` — Rule-based task classifier (7 types), skill selector, deterministic plan generator
  - `loop.ts` — Safe execution loop with permission-gated step execution, simulated MVP execution
  - `policies.ts` — 5-tier permission model with hierarchy checks, action-to-permission mapping
  - `sessionStore.ts` — In-memory session store with CRUD operations

- **Skills module** (`apps/runtime/src/skills/`):
  - `registry.ts` — Backend skills registry with 8 built-in skills, runtime updates via PATCH
  - `runner.ts` — Skills validator and runner with permission checks

- **Server** (`apps/runtime/src/server.ts`):
  - 8 new agent API endpoints added

### Frontend
- **AgentActivityFeed** (`apps/web/src/components/AgentActivityFeed.tsx`):
  - Timeline display of agent events with status icons, tool badges, file references, timestamps
- **AgentPlanPanel** (`apps/web/src/components/AgentPlanPanel.tsx`):
  - Expandable step list, permission badges, approve/reject buttons, status indicators for all plan states
- **ChatScreen** (`apps/web/src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx`):
  - Complete rewrite: sends tasks to agent session API, displays plan for approval, shows execution results
- **SkillsScreen** (`apps/web/src/screens/SkillsScreen.tsx`):
  - Fetches skills from backend `GET /api/agent/skills`, toggles via `PATCH /api/agent/skills/:id`

### API Endpoints Added
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/agent/session` | Create agent session |
| GET | `/api/agent/session/:id` | Get session with plan & events |
| POST | `/api/agent/session/:id/plan` | Classify task & generate plan |
| POST | `/api/agent/session/:id/approve` | Approve & execute plan |
| POST | `/api/agent/session/:id/reject` | Reject plan |
| GET | `/api/agent/session/:id/events` | Get session events |
| GET | `/api/agent/skills` | List registered skills |
| PATCH | `/api/agent/skills/:id` | Update skill config |

### Shared Types Added
- `AgentTaskType`, `PermissionLevel`, `AgentPlanStatus`, `AgentStepStatus`
- `AgentPlanStep`, `AgentPlan`, `AgentSessionInfo`, `AgentEvent`

### Documentation Added/Updated
- `docs/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` — Full agent loop architecture, approval flow, permission model, API reference
- `docs/SKILLS.md` — Updated with backend registry info and skill selection table
- `docs/SECURITY.md` — Added agent loop safety invariants and skill-level permission mapping

## Verification Results
- ✅ All 3 workspaces typecheck with 0 errors
- ✅ All 3 workspaces build successfully
- ✅ Agent approval flow guards correctly placed
- ✅ dangerous-disabled permissions permanently blocked
- ✅ No secrets in frontend code
- ✅ Skills screen fetches from backend with loading/error states
- ⚠️ MVP: Plans are deterministic/mock, no real LLM calls
- ⚠️ MVP: File writes and commands are simulated only
- ⚠️ Sessions are in-memory (lost on restart)
